# Java Programming – Core Concepts & Practice

This repository contains **structured Java programs** developed as part of my Semester 4 coursework and self-practice.
The focus is on **core Java fundamentals**, **object-oriented programming**, **exception handling**, and **database connectivity**, with an emphasis on **clean code and practical usage**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

* Build a strong foundation in **Java programming**
* Understand and apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles
* Practice **exception handling** and **robust program design**
* Work with **JDBC** for database-driven applications
* Develop **mini-projects** suitable for academic evaluation and portfolios
